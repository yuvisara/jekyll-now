```Learn something about everything and everything about something. T.X.Huxley```

I am an yet another computer professional who has a tech blog. I love open source software and have much respect for other tech blogs which makes a complicated subject palatable.  

This site is is a repository of some of the interesting things that I had encountered and what had worked for me.

Hope this helps others as well.
