```Learn something about everything and everything about something. T.X.Huxley```

I am still trying to get to my everyting something. I love open source software and have much respect for other tech blogs which makes a complicated subject look easy and simple.

This site is is a repository of some of the interesting things that I had encountered and what had worked for me.

Hope this helps others as well.
