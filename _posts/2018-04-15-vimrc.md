#### My .vimrc

```sh
set color desert #so that the comments are not blue
set showmatch #to move between the parent using %
set autoindent
set number
set tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 expandtab
```

#### Search and Replace 
```sh
:%s/foo/bar/g  #replace all occurence of foo with bar
:%s/foo/bar/gc #with for confirmation
```

#### Tabs:
```sh
tabe #to open a tab at the end
tabn #move to next tab
tabp #move to previous tab
```

#### Multiple windows:
```sh
:sp filename #horizontal split 
:vs filename #vertical split
```

and _ctrl+w_ and arrows to switch between the windows
