Reference: [AOC day 4 - Crossed Wires ](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/3)

There are two wires in a 2d grid and the problem was to find the closest intersection point.

For this, we can approach it in two ways 
* We can create a grid of max size and populate the wires.
* We can just keep track of the points along the wires and check if the second wire also has seen it.

I chose to try out the solution in javascript with the second approach.

__Part 1:__ I chose a map/dictionary data structure([code](https://github.com/yuvisara/coding_problems/blob/master/adventofcode/day3/cwire.js)) to keep track of the grid and populated with 1 if the wire goes through it.

__Part 2:__ Luckily the second part of the puzzle we need to remember the length of the wire, so instead of populating 1, populated the grid with the length of the first wire and if an intersection occurs then calculate the length using this value.
