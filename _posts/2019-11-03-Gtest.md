title: Unit testing using Gtest for C++
---

Recently I had setup gtest for a standalone project. It was to be self contained and not depend on the installed packages. So i decided to build and include it from a local directory itself. The project has the tests in test/ folder and the compiled binary files in bin/ folder and the dependencies in deps/ folder.

#### Getting Gtest
```bash
mkdir deps
cd deps
wget https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/release-1.8.1.tar.gz
```

#### Copying required files
```bash
tar -xvf release-1.8.1.tar.gz && \
cd googletest-release-1.8.1 && \
cmake3 -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON . && \
make
mkdir -p deps/gtest/lib
cp -rfv deps/googletest-release-1.8.1/googletest/include deps/gtest/include
cp -v deps/googletest-release-1.8.1/googlemock/gtest/*.so deps/gtest/lib
rm -rfv deps/googletest-release-1.8.1 release*
```

#### To use it include it while compiling
All the test files are present in test/directory and with names matching *_test.cpp.

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:$(pwd)/deps/ 
g++ -std=c++11 -I deps/gtest/include/ -L deps/gtest/lib/ -Wl,-rpath=deps/gtest/lib -lgtest -lgtest_main -o bin/test_out test/test_main.cpp test/*test.cpp
bin/test_out
```
